# Build with optimizations turned off

Before you use the delve debugger on a particular application,  it is important to remember that the Go compiler performs several optimizations that make it difficult to debug a program. These optimizations include things such as function inlining and registerization of variables (variables get stored in registers and not on the stack). In order to disable these optimizations, the -gcflags=’all=-N -l’ option should be used when building an application that is to be part of a debugging session. The optimizations are automatically disabled when launching a debug session using the delve debug command. However, when using delve attach to attach to a running process, these optimizations should be disabled when building the binary as illustrated below :
